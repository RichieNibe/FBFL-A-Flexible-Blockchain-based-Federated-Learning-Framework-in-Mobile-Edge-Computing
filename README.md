# FBFL-A-Flexible-Blockchain-based-Federated-Learning-Framework-in-Mobile-Edge-Computing
This framework is based on our previews research. It's a simulation platform for researchers and companies to apply blockchain in federated learning framework, and it can be applied in MEC. By far, it's a basic model, which provides most of the functions, such as attacks, data distribution analysis, blockchain consensus, etc. We will update it in the future.
