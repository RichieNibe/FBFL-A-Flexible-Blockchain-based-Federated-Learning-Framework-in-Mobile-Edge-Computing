# FBFL-A-Flexible-Blockchain-based-Federated-Learning-Framework-in-Mobile-Edge-Computing
This framework is based on our previews research. It's a simulation platform for researchers and companies to apply blockchain in federated learning framework, and it can be applied in MEC. By far, it's a basic model, which provides most of the functions, such as attacks, data distribution analysis, blockchain consensus, etc. We will update it in the future. 

## How to run it?
First, we will clarify the dependencies of this project.
1. python==3.9
2. keras==2.8.0
3. tensorflow==2.8.0
4. numpy==1.21.6
5. pandas==1.3.5
6. matplotlib==3.2.2
7. flask==1.1.4
8. requests==2.26.0

We recommend you to use virtual environment on Linux.

1. install all the required packages:

pip install -r requirement.txt

2. run the federated learning system in terminal:

python3 blfec.py

3. run the blockchain system in terminal:

python3 blockchain.py
